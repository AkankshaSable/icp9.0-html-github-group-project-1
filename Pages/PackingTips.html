   <h1><u>Packing Tips</u></h1> 
   <b><h3>Going on vacation is the best. Not so fun? Trying to cram your cutest outfits into your suitcase.</h3> </b>
   <b>1. Roll clothes and pack them first.</b> <br>
    The best way to prevent creases and make the most of your space is to use the roll method. Lay tops facedown,
     fold in the sleeves and roll from the bottom up. For pants, put the legs together and roll from the waist down. 
     Once you’ve rolled everything, place pants and tops in your suitcase before walking shoes and accessories; then, 
     fit in other oddly shaped items, like hair tools.<br> <br>
     <b>2. Choose travel-friendly fabrics.</b> <br>
        We always recommend opting for knits and stretchy fabrics while traveling. Even when these fabrics wrinkle,
         the creases will fall out when you hang them up. Woven fabrics (like linen or cotton twill) are more prone to wrinkling <br><br>
         <b>3. Pack the first outfit you'll want to wear on top.</b> <br>
            If you know you’re getting off the plane and going straight to dinner or a meeting, plan your outfit and put it into 
            your suitcase last. That way, when you arrive, you won’t have to dig through everything else to find it (plus, it will 
            be less likely to wrinkle). This strategy is a great excuse to think about what you’ll wear in advance so you don’t 
            make one of the biggest packing mistakes: waiting until the last minute to pack.<br> <br>
 <b>4. Place heavy items at the base.</b> <br>
    Keep weightier things like shoes and books by the wheeled end of your suitcase. This placement helps your bag stay stable 
    when upright, and stops other items from getting smushed. (We like Away’s The Carry-On — it topped our carry-on luggage test
     and has a 100-day trial period.)<br> <br>
