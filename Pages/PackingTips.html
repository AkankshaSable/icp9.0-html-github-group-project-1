   <b><h3>Going on vacation is the best. Not so fun? Trying to cram your cutest outfits into your suitcase.</h3> </b>
   <b>1. Roll clothes and pack them first.</b> <br>
    The best way to prevent creases and make the most of your space is to use the roll method. Lay tops facedown,
     fold in the sleeves and roll from the bottom up. For pants, put the legs together and roll from the waist down. 
     Once youâ€™ve rolled everything, place pants and tops in your suitcase before walking shoes and accessories; then, 
     fit in other oddly shaped items, like hair tools.
