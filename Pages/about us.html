        <p><h3>We know that traveling with us requires an investment—not just of your hard-earned money,<br/> but of your time and trust, too. That’s no small stuff. And it’s why we go far beyond the basics, <br/>in a big way. Here’s what you’ll get when you travel with us..... <h1>Exclusive experiences 🌺</h1></h3> </p>

         <h3><i> Going guided takes the guesswork out of travel, but we don’t think<br/> convenience should come at the cost of your independence. We make sure each <br/>itinerary includes a just-right mix of guided tours and group meals, plus <br/>plenty of free time so you can explore your own interests at your own pace.</i></h3>
           
         <h1><ul><u>Small groups (big difference)</u></ul></h1>

          <p><h3><i>Travel is about making true connections, and we cap our groups at 38 <br/>so you can do just that. For more immersive, hands-on experiences—think<br/> truffle hunting in Italy or paddling a kayak through a Peruvian jungle—we <br/>offer intimate, Small Group Tours for 10 to 22 travelers.</i></h3></p>

          <ul><h2>Matt</h2>
            <li>Matt first started touring with students while teaching at the EF <br/>London school more than 20 years ago. Traveling is now second nature <br/>to this Londoner, who can often be found sharing his favorite foodie <br/>spots across Europe with groups.</li>
          </ul>

          <img src="/Images/director2.webp"/><ul><h2>Gloria</h2>
            <li>A former professional ballet dancer and artistic director of an <br/>international dance center in Rome, Gloria has run tours with us for over <br/>25 years. “The experience of traveling goes through all the five <br/>senses,” she shares. “Everything will be different than at home, and that’s why we travel!”</li>

            <h1><i><u>“We learned so much from our local guides and Leonor was the greatest Tour Director ever!!!!”</u></i></h1>
