        <p><h3>We know that traveling with us requires an investment—not just of your hard-earned money,<br/> but of your time and trust, too. That’s no small stuff. And it’s why we go far beyond the basics, <br/>in a big way. Here’s what you’ll get when you travel with us..... <h1>Exclusive experiences 🌺</h1></h3> </p>

         <h3><i> Going guided takes the guesswork out of travel, but we don’t think<br/> convenience should come at the cost of your independence. We make sure each <br/>itinerary includes a just-right mix of guided tours and group meals, plus <br/>plenty of free time so you can explore your own interests at your own pace.</i></h3>

          <p><h3><i>Travel is about making true connections, and we cap our groups at 38 <br/>so you can do just that. For more immersive, hands-on experiences—think<br/> truffle hunting in Italy or paddling a kayak through a Peruvian jungle—we <br/>offer intimate, Small Group Tours for 10 to 22 travelers.</i></h3></p>
