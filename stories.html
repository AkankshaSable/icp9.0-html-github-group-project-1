        The gods smiled on Goa. They blessed this sun-kissed strip of the Indian coast with warm winter weather, whispering palms, fine food and friendly people, then garnished the dish with a string of sandy beaches, creating an almost unbroken strip of gold from Arambol to Polem. But with so many beaches to choose from, where to begin?

        Whether you’re after unspoiled golden shores, morning yoga classes under the palms or the last embers of the full-moon-flavoured hippy vibe that made the region so (in)famous, there’s a stretch of sand suited to you. Here’s our guide to Goa’s best beaches.

      Manali was breathtaking. When I arrived from the washout that was Dharamsala, it was so beautiful to finally see some sun!

      That along with tall mountains and beautiful luscious green scenery all around. We got off the night bus at the bus stand in Manali at 6 am pretty delirious as it was a rough ride.
      
      Punjabi music playing all night, a noisy engine, and an old bus that could hardly make it around the turns of the winding road weren’t exactly fun.
      
      But, on the upside, we made it in one piece. There are two parts to the world of Manali.
      
      These are new Manali, which has the congested Mall Road and is not very pretty, and Old Manali which is across the bridge over the Beas river.
      
      Both are an easy 1km walk away from each other so you can get the best of both worlds! Here’s your ULTIMATE Manali travel guide to the hippie town in Himachal.
